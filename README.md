NOTES FROM THE FUTURE:

This editor is pretty weird and was designed for a very specific dialog system. Most likely the project will be useless to anyone else as-is. It's also full of bugs and incomplete.

That being said, you may find how certain behaviors are implemented, such as TextArea copy/paste, which I have found no good references online for at the time (2017)
